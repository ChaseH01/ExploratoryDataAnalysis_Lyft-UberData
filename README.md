# Lyft and Uber Investigation

This version represents my personal adaptation of a project originally developed in collaboration with Matteo Dall'Olmo. It features my own refinements and revised documentation for clarity and portfolio purposes.

An investigation into Lyft and Uber rides in the Boston area from 11-26-2018 to 12-18-2018.
